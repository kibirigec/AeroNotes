Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on the API routes, especially login-with-pin, to prevent brute-force attacks.
Phone Number Validation: Consider a more robust library for phone number validation (e.g., libphonenumber-js).
PIN Complexity: While you have length checks, ensure users understand PIN security limitations.
